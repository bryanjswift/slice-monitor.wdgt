# SliceMonitor

SliceMonitor is a very simple and basic slice monitor that utilizes the Slicehost API to fetch some basic info about your slices such as bandwidth in & out, what IP address(es) it’s running on and what it’s current status is.

The big green indicator to the left turns orange whenever something is going on with the slice so you can quickly spot if something fishy is happening.

Of course, this is no replacement for any monitoring tool out there - it’s just something I felt was missing and threw together one night.
